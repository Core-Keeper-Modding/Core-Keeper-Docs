# How to install Core Keeper mono version

## Guide Deprecated

This guide was made for IL2CPP version of Core Keeper and no longer applies. Normal build of the game already uses mono

## Steps

* Right-click the game's name in Steam and select `Properties` from the menu
* Select `Betas`
* Enter the following password: `monobuildsmightnotbeuptodate`
* Click `Check Code`&#x20;
* Click the dropdown menu, select the mono branch, and click `opt in`
* Wait for the game to automatically update (or manually update it yourself)

If you wish to have both the mono build and il2cpp one use steamcmd to install and update the mono build. Follow this [guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388264242), replacing values for Core Keeper. Core Keeper appId is `1621690`
