# Reporting Bugs

If you think you've found a bug with a mod, share it with the mod developer so it can be fixed!

Make sure you've followed the steps on the Troubleshooting page first to make sure it's actually a bug and not something specific to your setup!

{% content-ref url="troubleshooting.md" %}
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Check the mod's page on mod.io to see if the developer has specified a specific place to report bugs. If you don't use the place they asked, there's a good chance they won't see your report.
