# No Console Support

{% hint style="danger" %}
Sorry... Core Keeper console editions do not support modding, and probably never will.
{% endhint %}

See this message from the developers:

> ... there will not be any mod support on consoles at launch, and **we will most likely never support mods on consoles** in the same way we do on PC. The platform owners (Sony in this case) have strict requirements for all games that are released on their consoles, and there is no reasonable way to comply with them if players can modify the game to any meaningful extent. If there are mod features that you would like to have on consoles, feel free to post a suggestion in ⁠[📋-feedback-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/851842678340845600/1019964660214153326) to potentially have it added to the main game 🤠\
