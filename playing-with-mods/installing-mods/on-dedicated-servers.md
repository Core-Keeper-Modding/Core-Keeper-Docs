# On Dedicated Servers

## Manual File Management

Open the[ mods folder ](../../concepts/important-folder-paths.md#dedicated-server-mods)and follow the same procedure as for the game.

Some mods only need to be installed client side or server side to function properly. The Mod SDK allows developers to specify if a mod is required on both sides, but mod.io does not display it to users anywhere, so it's up to the mod developer to tell you this somehow in the description page.

If the mod developer doesn't specify, it's best to **assume the mod is required on all sides**.
