# Uninstalling Mods

If you want to uninstall mods, try these different approaches in order from top to bottom. Each step is more "drastic" than the last, but you might need to use a more drastic solution if your install is broken.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're using an external tool to manage your mods, make sure to try using its methods of uninstalling mods before trying these, otherwise it might put them back again.
{% endhint %}

## Unsubscribe via the main menu's mods screen

As long as you can open the game, you can use the in-game mods menu to Unsubscribe from the mod you wish to uninstall.

It's best practice to restart the game after changing your installed mods in case some of the effects from a mod linger during the game session.

## Launch the game in "No Mods" mode then unsubscribe from mods

You might need to use this approach if one of your installed mods is making the Mods screen inoperable or inaccessible.

In Steam, open the game's Properties, then choose the following launch variant: `Play Core Keeper (no mods)`. This will force the game to not load any mods when it opens.

In this state you will be able to unsubscribe broken mods from the main menu and return your game back to working state. Remember to switch back after you're done, or any mods you install later won't load!

## Unsubscribe from all mods via mod.io website

If unsubscribing from mods in-game isn't working, try unsubscribing from them on the mod.io website. The "My Subscriptions" filter makes it easy to find them.

## Deleting mod files from your computer

Try deleting any mod files present in [your computer's 2 mod folders](../concepts/important-folder-paths.md#mod-files).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember, any mods you are still subscribed to on mod.io will be automatically re-downloaded by the game's mod.io integration!
