# Discovering Mods

## Find Core Keeper mods on the mod.io website!

You can browse available mods via the in-game UI (accessible via the main menu) or the mod.io site:&#x20;

{% embed url="https://mod.io/g/corekeeper" %}

Use the Filters system to focus what mods are displayed. For example, filter by only the latest **Game Version** to see only mods compatible with the current version of the game. There is a chance that mods without the latest version tag could still be working, but you'd be trying them at your own risk.

## DO NOT get mods from Thunderstore!

All mods on Thunderstore ([https://thunderstore.io/c/core-keeper/](https://thunderstore.io/c/core-keeper/)) are outdated and will not work on modern Core Keeper versions.
