# Elevated Access

Elevated-access mods have increased access to resources outside the game like user files and internet.

Mods that require elevated access should explain why they need it on their mod.io page.

> When installed, these mods have increased access to resources outside of the game such as user files and the internet. Because of this, we strongly recommend that players only install mods from reputable sources such as trusted mod creators.
>
> To support this, we have added a new category to [Mod.io](https://mod.io/g/corekeeper) called “Access Type” and, any mod that needs to run with elevated access will require the Access Type “Script (Elevated Access)”.
>
> Users will also experience a warning pop-up that appears when they subscribe to elevated-access mods that reads:
>
> **“Caution: 'Elevated Access' mods have increased access to resources outside the game like user files and the internet. For the best experience, install only from reputable sources.”**
