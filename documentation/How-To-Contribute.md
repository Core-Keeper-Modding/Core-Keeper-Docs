This wiki is an accumulation of the work of several people. 
To keep this wiki in the best state possible we ask of you to contribute wherever you think possible. 

## How do I make changes to the wiki if I don't have access to the organization?
Unfortunately GitHub's way to update the wiki is a bit convoluted but these steps should explain it: 

1. Fork the Getting-Started repository. 
2. Clone just the wiki of your forked repo to your local machine with `git clone {forked repo url}.wiki.git`
3. Make the changes you want. Be sure to adhere to the GitHub wiki naming convention.
4. Push the local changes to your forked repo.
5. Open a new issue with the Wiki PR issue template, write a brief overview on the changes you made and paste a direct link to the forked repo wiki (e.g. https://github.com/JrProgrammer/Getting-Started.wiki.git)
