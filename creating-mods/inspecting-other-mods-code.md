# Inspecting Other Mods' Code

These tutorials and guides are only capable of covering so much. If you want to become a real modder you will have to learn how to inspect other mods and the base game's files to implement your ideas.

## Opening Mod Files

Core Keeper mods are compiled at runtime, so you can simply open a mod's files to view contained C# code. Download the mod from the mod.io website, open the zip file, and check out the Scripts directory. Or directly open [the mod's directory on disk](../concepts/important-folder-paths.md#mod-files).

## Open Source Mods

A number of mods have their sources posted on GitHub. Example: [CoreLib](https://github.com/CoreKeeperMods/CoreLib). It's up to the individual mod developer to somehow provide links to their repositories, as mod.io does not have a "field" for communicating it.
