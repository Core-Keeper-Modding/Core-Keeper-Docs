# NG Tools Missing Script Recovery

{% embed url="https://mod.io/g/corekeeper/r/how-to-fix-missing-scripts" %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is currently a bug with NG Tools Missing Script recovery causing all Manual Pick UIs to not work correctly. In the case where you must use a Manual Pick, you will have to delete the broken script components then add them back manually, then find out what the values were using Unity Explorer.

We do not have access to the source of NG Tools to fix this bug, but we have contacted the original developer.
