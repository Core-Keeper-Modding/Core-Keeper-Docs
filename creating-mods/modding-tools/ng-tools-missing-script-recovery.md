# NG Tools Missing Script Recovery

{% embed url="https://mod.io/g/corekeeper/r/how-to-fix-missing-scripts" %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is currently a bug with NG Tools Missing Script recovery causing all Manual Pick UIs to not work correctly. In the case where you must use a Manual Pick, you will have to delete the broken script components then add them back manually, then find out what the values were using Unity Explorer.
