# Asset Ripper

Asset Ripper will allow you to extract the base game's assets and load imitations of them in your modding SDK project.&#x20;

After importing the assets you'll have to use the [Missing Script Recovery Tool](ng-tools-missing-script-recovery.md) to be able to view components and their settings.&#x20;
